## Face Detection with OpenCV and Python

### A software created to detect human faces with an input image

In the modern era, facial image processing has widely attracted attention through face detection from images and videos. This has enormous application value and market potential in video surveillance, multimedia and face recognition. Various research has been done on facial detection and processing such as tracking of the face and clustering detected faces. Due to face detectionâ€™s diverse applications, the goal of this paper is to provide an overview of face detection systems and multiple approaches to solve using the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library.

#### Language and Program Library: Written in Python 3.7, the program uses OpenCV library which is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.
